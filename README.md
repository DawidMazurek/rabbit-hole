Aim of the project, is to build complex solution for rabbitMQ based environments

Planned features:
* single-fire tasks
* multiple execution tasks
* delayed execution tasks
* solution for dispatching tasks to rabbitMQ server
* workers to take care of tasks execution

Project will limit users from need to communicate with rabbitMQ server directly
